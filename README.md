# voting your favorite pizza!

## introduction 
Who can say no to a good pizza!? sometimes I like to get crafty and make my own,
other times I am looking at the specialty ones, but how do you know if they are any good.
There is nothing worse than ordering a pizza that looks delicious and after waiting and waiting
you take your first bite and realize that you made the wrong decision. Now, this app allows
users to add their own creations of pizzas, upload them, and then vote on how they thought it was.

## setup
This project takes a list of pizzas from a json file and renders them onto the page.
A form was created so that you could add the names of different pizzas and its information and add
them to the json file. You can vote on whether you believe which ever pizzas you like and which ones you dont. You can also look over each pizza to zoom in and get an enlarged view of what each one looks like.

### Credits

I would like to give credit to a few youtube videos and walkthroughs/tutorials for practice and help learn about patch and post requests I was watching that helped me with this project. It gave me a lot of help taking that information and using it to help me along.
